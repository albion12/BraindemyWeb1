              width="100%" /> <br>Training is instruction aimed at procedural knowledge and proficiency, at knowing how
            to execute the procedures necessary to do a job. It can be distinguished from declarative knowledge, which
            is knowledge of facts or static information. Training programs have three general goals: successful
            training, transfer to the work situation (generalization), and long-term use on the job of what was learned
            (maintenance). Training can be structured for trainees to learn individually (either in competition with
            peers or on their own) or in teams. Training can focus on individuals who are selected from their job
            situations (or from a general population of potential job applicants), assigned to training teams and given
            training, and then returned to their job situations (where the trainees work alone or as part of a team,
            which may be nested in a network of teams).

            <br>Searching for the top technology events to attend in 2020? Scouring the internet for event information
            can feel quite overwhelming. That's why we've done all the work for you! This carefully curated conference
            directory features over 100 (and growing) 2020 tech conferences around the world.
            The Tech Events featured in this list take place all throughout the year and cover a wide range of different
            industries
            Due to the amount of increased programming and limited space, beginning December 25, 2020, all department
            sponsored event bookings will be limited to a two date hold maximum per event. You may reserve a series of
            dates (i.e., Monday-Wednesday), however, you may not reserve more than two series of dates. The decision
            regarding the final date must be made within 60 days so that the other day(s) can be released.

            <h1><a href="latest.html">Latest</a></h1> <br> <img src="Images/latest.png" alt="" width="100%" /><br> In computer
            terms, “vision” involves systems that are able to identify items, places, objects or people from visual
            images – those collected by a camera or sensor. It’s this technology that allows your smartphone camera to
            recognize which part of the image it's capturing is a face, and powers technology such as Google Image
            Search.

            As we move through 2020, we’re going to see computer vision equipped tools and technology rolled out for an
            ever-increasing number of uses. It’s fundamental to the way autonomous cars will “see” and navigate their
            way around danger. Production lines will employ computer vision cameras to watch for defective products or
            equipment failures, and security cameras will be able to alert us to anything out of the ordinary, without
            requiring 24/7 monitoring.

            Computer vision is also enabling face recognition, which we will hear a lot about in 2020. We have already
            seen how useful the technology is in controlling access to our smartphones in the case of Apple's FaceID and
            how Dubai airport uses it to provide a smoother customer journey. However, as the use cases will grow in
            2020, we will also have more debates about limiting the use of this technology because of its potential to
            erode privacy and enable 'Big Brother'-like state control.
